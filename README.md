# GrandPy Bot, a travel story chatbot
## Long story short

GrandPy Bot is a chatbot, hosted [here](https://grandpy.herokuapp.com), linked to both [Wikimedia France](https://fr.wikipedia.org) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) APIs. His only purpose is to answer natural language requests with a location and an extract of a related wikipedia page.

## How to use ?

Once on the main (and only) page, you just have to ask something about a location, and GrandPy will do his work !

## What if he doesn't understand my answer ?

A debugging tool is being set up, once it's online GrandPy will provide you a quick form with the words he didn't understand. You shall tick every words that is not a location and send it back to him.
